# AI-DLC State Tracking

## Project Information
- **Project**: Plan OrbitSleuth, a resume-ready interactive AI exoplanet investigation platform. Users explore telescope light curves, investigate unusual signals with tool-backed AI analysis, and receive evidence-linked hypotheses such as exoplanet transit, stellar activity, or noise. The product must never claim a discovery without supporting evidence and must keep a human reviewer in control. Begin with AI-DLC discovery and planning only: do not generate application code, provision cloud resources, or create a deployment plan until I approve the Unit of Work. The target outcome is a visually compelling web experience with a Python analysis backend, an interactive frontend, evaluation, observability, and a future AWS deployment path.
